Here is an example: 

```bash
[
    [
        {
            "Name": "Alice Smith",
            "UPN": "alice@swjm.blog",
            "Model": "YubiKey 5 NFC",
            "Serial number": 12345678,
            "PIN": "5144",
            "PIN change required": false
            "Secure Transport Mode": false
        }
    ],
    [
        {
            "Name": "Mike Smith",
            "UPN": "mike@swjm.blog",
            "Model": "YubiKey 5C NFC",
