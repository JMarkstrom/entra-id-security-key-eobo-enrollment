## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About
This repository presents a Python script (`sk-entra-id.py`) that facilitates configuration of a YubiKey as well as its assignment to a user in Microsoft **Entra ID**. 
The script is based on a **Yubico** Proof-of-Concept found [here](https://github.com/YubicoLabs/entraId-register-passkeys-on-behalf-of-users) and performs the following configuration tasks:
